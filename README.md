### Running the Applications
 
### How to play
**Rule:
+ Each player is given a random starting card. Players then take turns to "Stick" or "Twists". If they "twists", they are given another (random) card and then it becomes their opponent's turn. The opponent also chooses "Sticks" or "Twists" and have the choice to either draw a card or not. At this point that player receives no more cards.They can carry on with the action until they choose "Sticks". 
+ An "ACE" can be counted as either 1 or 11

**Objective:
+ The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible points value of their cards without going above the value of 21. If a player "Twists" and their total go over 21, they lose the game.
+ If both players choose to stick without going over 21, the winner is the player who has the highest points value when all their cards are added together.
